This is a 2 students project made for the GMTK 2024 Game Jam around the theme "Built to Scale". 
Not all assets were made by us but they were all allowed under their different licenses.
Lastly I hope you enjoy our tiny little game about a tiny little witch trying to get some rest, I'm off to get some myself.
